        <p>Hi, I'm Josh and I am on the computer.</p>
        <p>I'm mainly interested in open source software, cybersecurity, a touch of
          game dev, retrocomputing, and amateur radio.</p>
        <p>This site serves as a place for me to document my explorations into
          those fields. check out the <a href="/posts">posts</a> page to follow those
          adventures.</p>
